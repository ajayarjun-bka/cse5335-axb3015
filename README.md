###What SQL or NOSQL database did you choose and why?
I have chosen MongoDb as my database because, I was not much concerned about the structure of data as well as acid properties.It was just reading data through Ajax calls. Moreover mongodb outputs json which is very easy to handle.

###What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?
I found Mongoose module to be provide an easy means to interface with the database through schema mappings.

###What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?
Timing the animation effect was little bit hard 

###If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest concern?
The biggest concern would be being updated on these technologies as they evolve rapidly
