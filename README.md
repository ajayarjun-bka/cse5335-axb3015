###What server framework did you choose and why?
I have chosen Node.jS as server side framework.

**The Following were the reasons for choosing Node.js:**

* It uses java script on server side. I was not forced to learn a new server side language as i already had prior knowledge of JavaScript.
* It is fast.Node.js uses V8 engine by Google which is  written in JavaScript and has an exceptional running speed.It follows asynchronous execution and non blocking execution which increases the throughput of the server.
* Has a very large open source community support.

Node.js may not serve as an ideal solution for CPU intensive tasks. Node.js serves as an ideal solution for my problem because my code is going to serve data through REST API's

###What client framework did you choose and why?
I have used AngularJS as client side framework.

**The Following were the reasons for choosing Node.js:**

* To build single page web app using the module ngRoute.Single Page apps are the current trend in web-development. It provides a very good user experience.
* To achieve  two way Data binding, which is requires lot of coding if other frameworks are used.

I have also used JQuery in some places to manipulate some of the static content.

###What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?
Using Express framework made it easy to set up web server. Setting up web server using nodejs needed some more coding to handle MIME types,routes etc..

###What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?
Understanding the concept of using middle-ware in express framework was kind of confusing.

###What components other than your client and server framework did you install?
Express framework was installed to simplify the implementation of web server ,pug template engine to replace html markup. It reduced the html code and introduced more readability and organization to the  coed structure

###What Ubuntu commands are required to deploy and run your server?
I did not  use any Ubuntu commands explicitly. I encountered commands like npm install --express, git related commands.
